# Retail-Lakehouse

This is a simple project to explore basic business scenarios but with real-time industry depth.
We will explore the use case for retail analytics.


## Getting started

### Business Usecase

We have a retail e-commerce business where customers order products from the website.
The products are then shipped to the customers' addresses. A shipment is tracked through different statuses ( shipped, delivered, cancelled). Once delivered, the customers share their feedback on the website on the product.

One order can have multiple products in them.
