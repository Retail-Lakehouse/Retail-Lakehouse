#Business Goal 1: Enhance Customer Satisfaction and Product Understanding through Reviews Analysis
KPIs:
1. Calculate the average sentiment score of customer reviews i.e. Customer Sentiment Score (CSS) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 
2. Measure the percentage of customers who have written reviews compared to the total number of customers who made purchases i.e.  Review Participation Rate (RPR). This provides insights into customer engagement and willingness to share feedback.
3. Analyze reviews to identify the most frequently mentioned product features and their sentiment scores. This helps in understanding what aspects of the product are most important to customers.
4. Quantify the number of reviews mentioning specific pain points or issues customers are facing with products. This helps prioritize improvements.
5. Track the total number of reviews and the average ratings per product to assess popularity and customer satisfaction trends.

#Business Goal 2: Optimize Product Sales Strategy and Seasonal Offerings
KPIs:
1. Analyze sales data to identify the products that exhibit significant seasonal purchasing patterns. Determine which products have the highest sales during different seasons.
2. Calculate the average sales and ratings for each product category. Identify the categories with the highest and lowest sales and ratings.
3. Determine the frequency of product combinations purchased together. Identify popular product bundles to optimize cross-selling strategies.
